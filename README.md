# MrDonaldsProject

This project you can found by url: https://mrdonalds-23ccc.web.app/

# Here I will present several implemented possibilities:

- One of my proudest achievements in this project is the implementation of Firebase, including Realtime Database, Functions, Authentication, and Hosting. One of the functionalities of this project is that when you make an order, you receive an email with the order details.

  - In this picture, you can see my project in its current view. I hope to improve it further in the future.

  - After you try to order something, the system will ask you to log in. In the picture below, you will see what it looks like when you have already login.

  - If you are already logged in, you can make your first order. In the picture below, you can see what the modal window looks like when you edit an item from the menu.

  - When you have decided what you want to order, my project will look like the picture below.

  - Now you can check your email for a letter from my work email address. There, you will find your order details, as shown in the picture below.

- This project was initially created as a way to learn React.js and gain an understanding of how it works. This explains its appearance. However, as the project progressed, it became a valuable addition to my resume. Despite this, I have set a personal goal to implement a mobile version of the project.

# If you wanna download the source code to your system, this some tips on how to run it:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
